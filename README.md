# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Supabase Auth

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication. Provide the following environment variables to enable the login flow:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

You can sign in at `/login` with an email and password, sign up for a new account at `/register`, and sign out from the main page header.
